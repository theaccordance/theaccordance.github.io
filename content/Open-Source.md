- Requirements to be a project contributor
- Process of making contributions to projects
- What happens when I submit my contribution?
    - what if my PR is flat out rejected?
    - I submitted a PR 5ever ago and nothing's happened, what do I do?
- What do I do after my contribution has been accepted?



## Requirements to be a project contributor:
- Sufficient expertise to provide quality, complete code contributions
- Some projects require contributors sign agreements to clear the project of any liability over IP claims

## Process of making contributions to projects
- Different projects have different levels of formality.
    - Formal: Process is clearly documented.  If they took the time to write out the process in detail, follow their steps, otherwise don't bet on your contributions being accepted.
    - Informal: Little or No documentation on the process.  Best recommendation is to first create an issue to start a discussion with the project's author, as the author can provide additional details (style, code qualtiy, etc).  If you submit an issue and the author does not respond, the project may be abandoned.  
- General Flow
    - Find or Submit an Issue: Best is to find an existing issue that's open.  
    - Fork Repo
    - Clone Locally
    - Create Branch
    - Make Changes
    - Test
    - Documentation
    - Push changes to remote
    - Create pull-request 

## What happens when I submit my contribution?
- At minimum a code review to undestand the changes being applied.
- Some (Most) projects are set up with continuous integration tools to validate code changes against a testing suite.  Even those without CI likely have testing 


## What do I do after my contribution has been accepted?
- Inquire about the projected release date.  Some projects will have information relating to their cycles, some wont.  It's good to know when your code will go live.
- Verify that the appropriate level of credit has been provided for your work.  
- Shameless self promotion.  If Adding references to your contributions in professional or social networks creates personal value, then do it in a tasteful manner.  
- Stay in the loop.  You're not obligated to maintain the code, but it's very neighborly to be accessible if things arise relating to your code.
