# How SoundCloud could improve their mobile UX

This post was inspired by [Things I would build if I worked at GitHub](https://kevin.is/committed-to-github/)

SoundCloud is the only music app that I use on my mobile phone.  I used to pay for Spotify but my preference music switched from picking tracks ale cart to hearing full artist performances (sets).  It's an experience unique amongst the sound apps that I would consider using.  (Got recommendations? Pass them along)

This is a opinion article written from my personal experiences.  

Why are these features missing?  Could be a number of reasons:
- Pivot in the direction of the company
- Shift in Priorities
- Churn Rate
- Outsourced (constrained budget)


## Continuity
I regularly switch between devices when using SoundCloud.
- Retrieve updated likes/etc on app launch or after sitting in the background for an extended period (defect)
- Pass along the song & position that was played on a different device (pick up where I left off) (enhancement)

## Improve overlapping UI interactions
When I go to move a set position to start at a specific track (say 15 minutes into a 2 hour set) and I end up sliding left and moving into an ad (which I'm stuck at - check re: pro).  I see two possible approaches to improve this situation:
- Add additional intelligence behind showing ads.  If the amount of time actually listned to a set is under a certain amount, don't lock the user into an advertisement.  (Personally, I don't think this is the best fix)
- Refactor the play interface - eliminate the overlap.  Perhaps that's by moving the prev/next to the header, or it's refactoring the track progress bar.  

## Social
How does a service who's own about page states that they are the "world's leading social sound platfom" exclude interaction, a key component of social from their mobile app?  Okay, sure, you can like, and repost sounds, but what about real sharing?  Where you send a specific person a track?  The feature exists on the desktop, but it doesn't on mobile.  You can't even access the messages on mobile.  

The absence of this feature forces me to use not one, but two mediums to send tracks when I'm on mobile.  For mobile -> mobile sharing, I send via Text, and for mobile -> desktop sharing, I send via FB.  Sure, I could do things like like/repost and tell the user, but that puts effort on them to find the song (bad ux).  Instead, I'm putting in additional work on my end to make sure it's easy for them.  

## Offline Caching
This enhancement would be very welcomed among those I know who have similar listening habits.  In fact, I would be willing to pay for this feature alongside no advertisements.
